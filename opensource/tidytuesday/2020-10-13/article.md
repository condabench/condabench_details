The Datasaurus data package
===========================


#### 2024\-02\-26


This package wraps the awesome Datasaurus Dozen dataset, which
contains [13](https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/Bakers-dozen.html) sets
of x\-y data. Each sub\-dataset has five statistics that are (almost) the
same in each case. (These are the mean of x, mean of y, standard
deviation of x, standard deviation of y, and Pearson correlation between
x and y). However, scatter plots reveal that each sub\-dataset looks very
different. The dataset is intended to be used to teach students that it
is important to plot their own datasets, rather than relying only on
statistics.


The Datasaurus was created by Alberto Cairo. Datasaurus shows us why
visualisation is important, not just summary statistics.


He’s been subsequently made even more famous in the paper [Same
Stats, Different Graphs: Generating Datasets with Varied Appearance and
Identical Statistics through Simulated Annealing](https://www.research.autodesk.com/publications/same-stats-different-graphs/) by Justin Matejka
and George Fitzmaurice.


In the paper, Justin and George simulate a variety of datasets that
the same summary statistics to the Datasaurus but have very different
distributions.


This package looks to make these datasets available for use as an
advanced [Anscombe’s
Quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet), available in R as `anscombe`.



Usage
-----


To see that statistics are (almost) the same for each sub\-dataset,
you can use `dplyr`.



```
library(datasauRus)
if(requireNamespace("dplyr")){
  suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
  datasaurus_dozen %>% 
    group_by(dataset) %>% 
    summarize(
      mean_x    = mean(x),
      mean_y    = mean(y),
      std_dev_x = sd(x),
      std_dev_y = sd(y),
      corr_x_y  = cor(x, y)
    )
}
```


```

## 13 x_shape      54.3   47.8      16.8      26.9  -0.0656
```

To see that each sub\-dataset looks very different, you can draw
scatter plots.



```
if(requireNamespace("ggplot2")){
  library(ggplot2)
  ggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, colour = dataset))+
    geom_point()+
    theme_void()+
    theme(legend.position = "none")+
    facet_wrap(~dataset, ncol = 3)
}
```


```
