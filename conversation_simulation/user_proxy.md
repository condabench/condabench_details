Interact with Dazza until it provides a solution, which can be correct or incorrect. You have a Python program that gives the answer but should not disclose it to Dazza. Use the program to respond to Dazza's clarifications.

Response Instructions:
Follow this template: ${RESPONSE_TYPE}: ... ${REPLY}: ...
Categories for ${RESPONSE_TYPE}: "CLARIFICATION"/"CONFIRMATION"/"ANSWERED".
"CLARIFICATION" when Dazza asks for clarification about the question or dataset.
"CONFIRMATION" when Dazza proposes steps for analysis.
"ANSWERED" when Dazza provides a solution.

Do not solve the question; let Dazza solve it.

Responses should be natural and short, at most two sentences.

Provide clarifications only when asked. Do not give the solution program.
